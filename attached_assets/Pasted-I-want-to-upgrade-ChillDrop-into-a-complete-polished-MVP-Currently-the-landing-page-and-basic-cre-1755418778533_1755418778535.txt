I want to upgrade ChillDrop into a complete, polished MVP. Currently, the landing page and basic create/join room flow are working, but several critical features and design improvements are missing. Please carefully implement the following:

üîπ Functional Features (Missing / Incomplete)

File Upload System

Drag & drop area + ‚Äúclick to upload‚Äù option

Support files up to 250MB each with chunked upload to Supabase Storage

Show progress bar, upload speed, and ETA

Allow multiple file uploads at once

File Management

Display uploaded files with filename, size, upload time, and expiry countdown

Add file type preview for images, PDFs, text, and videos

Generate short-lived signed download URLs (15 min expiry) for secure access

Room Expiry & Auto-Cleanup

Ensure files/rooms auto-delete after chosen expiry (1h, 6h, 12h, 24h)

Add Supabase scheduled cleanup function

Password Protection

Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt in the DB (not stored in plain text)

Room access requires password validation if enabled

Chat System

Real-time chat works, but improve with:

Typing indicators

Emoji picker

Ability to send small files or images in chat

üîπ Design & UX Improvements

Landing Page

More unique and professional design (glassmorphism cards, smooth gradient transitions, modern fonts)

Add subtle hover animations on buttons and cards

Replace plain gradient with a dynamic gradient or animated background

Dark/Light Mode

Add a toggle in the navbar to switch themes automatically

Room Page

Redesign layout to look cleaner:

Left side ‚Üí File upload + file list

Right side ‚Üí Chat panel

Top ‚Üí Room info (name, expiry, participant count, share link button, QR code)

Branding

Keep the name ChillDrop, but make the logo more stylish

Improve overall visual hierarchy so it feels like a professional SaaS product, not just a student project

üîπ Stretch Features (Optional if possible)

File search & filter inside room

QR code generation for sharing room links

Simple usage stats (file count, storage used, participants in room)

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Keep using)

React + Vite + TailwindCSS

Supabase (DB, Auth, Realtime, Storage)

Framer Motion for smooth animations

‚ö° Please implement all missing functionality and update the design to be modern, beautiful, professional, and unique.
